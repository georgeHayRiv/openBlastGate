# openBlastGate
This project is a combination of software and hardware to automate opening woodshop blast gates and turn a dust collector on and off. It implements a WiFi mesh (painlessMesh) network to communicate between devices to cut down on number of wires strung around the shop. It can control commercial and DIY gates. Gate opening devices that use stepper motors, servos, pneumatic cylinders, or manual gates. Dust collectors from a shopVac to a contractor controlled 240 volt system can be used. The system can be controlled with button or three type of current sensors.

More to come.
