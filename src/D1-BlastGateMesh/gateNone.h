// This might be used in a very simple setup where there is a shop vac and a chop saw and no other devices and no blast gate.
// Using this with a current sensor on the chap saw could signal a seperate dust collector module to turn the shop vac on.
//
// Nothing happens below and these are just placeholders

// ---------------- include the following functions to be called in the main code ---------------------
void openBlastGate(){
  //This gets called in the code when a button is pressed or a woodworking machine is turned on.
  
 }
  void closeBlastGate(){  
  //This gets called when the gate needs to be closed. It is normally in response to a different gate being opened
  
 }

void gateSetup(){
  // add any code that needs to run in the setup.
}
 void gateLoop(){
  //if any action needs to be done in the loop add it here, if not just leave it blank.
  
}
